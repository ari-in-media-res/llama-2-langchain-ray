      "The ActorPoolingStrategy is a mechanism in Ray that allows you to manage a pool of actor instances for your application. The strategy is responsible for creating, scheduling, and managing the lifecycle of actor instances in the pool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some key aspects of the ActorPoolingStrategy in Ray:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Instance Creation: The ActorPoolingStrategy creates actor instances based on the number of instances specified in the `actor_count` parameter of the `ExecutionOptions`. The strategy can also create instances with different configurations, such as different numbers of CPU cores or memory allocations.\n",
      "2. Instance Scheduling: Once created, the actor instances are scheduled by the strategy based on their availability and the needs of the application. The strategy can schedule instances to run tasks, handle messages, or perform other actions as needed.\n",
      "3. Lifecycle Management: The ActorPoolingStrategy manages the lifecycle of actor instances in the pool, including starting, stopping, and restarting instances as needed. The strategy can also handle failures and recoveries of instances, ensuring that the pool remains healthy and productive.\n",
      "4. Load Balancing: The ActorPoolingStrategy can distribute tasks across the actor instances in the pool, using load balancing algorithms to ensure that no single instance is overloaded. This helps to improve the performance and scalability of the application.\n",
      "5. Actor Placement Group Removal: When an actor instance is removed from the pool, the ActorPlacementGroupRemoved event is triggered. This event allows the application to take appropriate action, such as rebalancing the workload or cleaning up resources.\n",
      "6. Actor Summaries: The ActorSummaries class provides a summary of the actor instances in the pool, including their current state, resource usage, and other relevant information. This information can be used to monitor the health and performance of the pool.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the ActorPoolingStrategy in Ray provides a flexible and efficient way to manage a pool of actor instances for your application. By leveraging the strategy's capabilities, you can improve the performance, scalability, and reliability of your application, while also simplifying the management of your actor instances.\n"

      "4. `min_num_actors`: The minimum number of actors that must be present in the pool before it starts scheduling tasks. This parameter is optional and defaults to 0, which means the pool will start scheduling tasks as soon as it has any available actors.\n",
      "5. `task_timeout`: The timeout period for tasks in the pool. This parameter is optional and defaults to 0, which means there is no timeout for tasks.\n",
      "6. `heartbeat_interval`: The interval at which the actors in the pool send heartbeats to the ActorPoolStrategy. This parameter is optional and defaults to 10 seconds.\n",
      "7. `max_heartbeat_misses`: The maximum number of heartbeat misses allowed before an actor is considered failed. This parameter is optional and defaults to 3.\n",
      "8. `actor_creation_timeout`: The timeout period for creating new actors in the pool. This parameter is optional and defaults to 0, which means there is no timeout for actor creation.\n",
      "9. `actor_shutdown_timeout`: The timeout period for shutting down actors in the pool. This parameter is optional and defaults to 0, which means there is no timeout for actor shutdown.\n",

      "Step 1: Initialize Ray runtime\n",
      "-------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we need to initialize the Ray runtime by calling `Ray.init()`. This sets up the necessary infrastructure for running tasks in parallel.\n",

      "\n",
      "Step 3: Define the `square` method as a Ray task\n",
      "----------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "We define the `square` method as a Ray task by annotating it with `@RayMethod`. This tells Ray that this method should be executed as a separate task in parallel. We also specify the return type of the method as `ObjectRef<Integer>`, which means that each task will return an `ObjectRef` object representing the result of the calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the code for defining the `square` method as a Ray task:\n",

      "public static ObjectRef<Integer> square(int x) {\n",
      "    return x * x;\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "Step 4: Invoke the `square` method remotely as Ray tasks\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we have defined the `square` method as a Ray task, we can invoke it remotely as a series of tasks. We use the `ray.get()` method to submit each task and retrieve the results.\n",
